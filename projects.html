<p>Developing more accessible, small-displacement (250cc to 500cc) motorcycles for Asia markets through a planned alliance with a manufacturer in Asia. These new products are intended to fuel Harley-Davidson’s customer access and growth in some of the largest, fastest growing markets in the world.
    Leading the electrification of motorcycles by launching Harley-Davidson’s first electric motorcycle LiveWire™, in 2019 -- the first in a broad, no-clutch “twist and go” portfolio of electric two-wheelers designed to establish the company as the leader in the electrification of the sport. LiveWire will be followed by additional models through 2022 to broaden the portfolio with lighter, smaller and even more accessible product options to inspire new riders with new ways to ride.</p>
